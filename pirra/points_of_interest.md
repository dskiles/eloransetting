### Pirran Points of Interest

#### The Black Citadel
Sitting on the highest of Libussa's hills, the Black Citadel looms large over the citizenry's bodies and souls.  

Captured by Valdis the Far-Seeing two millenia ago, not even its inhuman inhabitants knew of its true origins.  Since its capture, the Black Citadel has served as Pirra's ultimate seat of power - first as a seat of kings, then as an Imperial proconsularium, and now, as the accorded seat of the Ecumenical Synod.

The immense structure rises five hundred and three feet above the ground.  Its halls are packed with clerics and scribes of all holy orders, each doing his or her best to keep the wheels of Pirran civilizaton turning.  Rumor has it that the citadel plunges *at least* as deeply into the earth, and that this is where the Inquisition keeps its secret councils.

#### The Libussan Academy
The Libussan Academy is an organization dedicated to preserving knowledge before it is lost, and forging ahead into unknown arts and sciences.  Founded as a philosophical boarding school in 4,420 AC, the Academy has educated some of the finest minds in history.  Since The Event, however, the Academy has expanded its charter to meet far more practical needs.  In the modern day, the Academy's most prominent departments are the the Expeditionary College, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the College Scholastica.  

Of the three, the College Scholastica hews most closely to its original charter.  It accepts any student capable of passing its rigorous entry exams, and offers them a free education in any number of practical studies.  Countless students have entered its doors, only to leave them years later as doctors, engineers, surveyors, barristers, or other skilled professionals.

The College of Arts and Sciences is a research institution dedicated to expanding the boundaries of knowledge.  Though their work is highly theoretical, it has paid great dividends to Pirran society.  Their work on bouyancy lead directly to the ironclad coastal defense ships that keep vigil over Pirra's shores.  Their research into the nature of festering wounds have saved thousands of soldiers from sepsis and infection in the last decade alone.  Investigation into the nature of thaumaturgical magic has given birth to the entire field of alchemy.  Through their efforts, the future looks more promising every day.

The Expeditionary College is the newest, and leat orthodox of the Academy's factions.  Chartered just twenty years ago, this college's primary mission is to seek out and recover powerful artifacts from around the world.  Few members of the college are highly educated, and many come from rough, dangerous backgrounds.  Despite their disrepute, these members all have unique experiences and skills that let them survive and thrive in highly dangerous field of artifact recovery.  These artifacts can turn the tide against Pirra's multitude of foes.

#### Mad Pyotr's Tower
At the tender age of twelve, Pyotr Rassimovich shocked the Imperium by crushing an entire army of Chernikan Penitents in a torrent of arcane power.  A unique, unprecedent prodigy, Pyotr was admitted to the Libussan Academy as soon as he could be taken there.  

Pyotr was as brilliant in matters academic as he was in matters arcane, and quickly rose through the ranks of the Academy, attaining the rank of Chancellor by the time he was twenty four.  Wise in Council, Fierce in Battle, and Canny in Word, many thought that Pyotr would be adopted into the Imperial Family itself.

Despite his fame and reputation, Pyotr grew more erratic as his tenure (some say reign) progressed.  His research into teleportation and planar travel sent him to the far corners of the world and beyond, and after one especially long trip, Pyotr came back *changed*.  Upon his return, he renounced his office, and began construction of an enormous tower West of Libussa.  Once complete, he stepped inside and never returned to the outside world.

In the intervening centuries, people from all over the world have entered the tower.  Some seek audience with Pyotr, while others seek to plunder his discarded riches.  The interior of the tower seems to exist outside the accordance of any natural law, and within its walls, *Pyotr's* law reigns supreme.
