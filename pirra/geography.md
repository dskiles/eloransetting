#### Pirran Geography
Pirra holds more geographic territory than any nation in the known world.  Its borders encompass a wide array of geographies and climes, from alpine glaciers, to endless steppes, to boreal forests and icy tundra.

The Pirran border with the Diaspora is protected by the **Kamenogogy**, or "Stone Curtain".  This immense mountain range has over a dozen peaks that that rise above 15,000 feet.  The tallest, called the "Godspear", rises a sky-piercing six miles above sea level.  The region is geologically active, with explosive volcanic eruptions and earthquakes leveling hundreds of square miles every few centuries.

North of the Kamenogogy, the land descends into rolling foothills, followed by hundreds of miles of forest and steppe.  North of Libussa, the step rapidly gives way to the **Morotslana**, or "Sea of Frost".  The Morotslana is a boreal tundra, teaming rich in wild game and deposits of precious metals.

Pirra's western reaches are dominated by water.  The **Temen Strait** separates the vicious raider-nation of Temen from Libussa's shores.  The <BIG SEA> and <BIG INLAND SEA> offer immense bounties of fish and other foods every day.

The <EASTERN OCEAN> that laps against Pirra's eastern shores has long been a source of national anxiety.  For centuries it was the origin of Jhil and Chernikan invasion fleets.  More recently, the sunless, fungal horrors of the moonshadow have found their way beneath the waves.  Colonies like Seeben and Sinzengen have been established as bastions against this threat.  The alien growth of the Penumbra has begun to change the land around them, and the residents have found themselves to be pioneers:  settlers of a foreign land within their own borders.

Thousands of lakes and rivers mark the surface of Pirra's territory.  It is these rivers that have held Pirra together.  Barges and boats ply their waters, linking towns and cities all through the nation's interior.  Even the recent invention of railroads has not displaced them as the premiere method of Pirran travel.
